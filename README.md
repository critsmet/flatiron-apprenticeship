The Challenge

For this challenge, we’d like you to build a simple app that takes the input of a github username, hits the Github Public API (specifically the /users/:username endpoint), and displays some basic information, such as name, email, company, and number of public repos. 

How?

However you like! This challenge is meant to be language, platform, and framework agnostic. How you choose to visualize the user data is totally up to you, whether you output to a terminal or make a view on a webpage. Use whatever tools make this easiest for you, there is no “right” way to do it.

Requirements
There are some requirements. 
Don’t take more than 2 hours. We respect your time and do not want you to spend too much of it building this. Whatever you have accomplished in 2 hours is great. 
Build with other people in mind. Write this as if you know other people will be reading it, working on it and possibly extending it. You will be sharing this with your potential teammates, act as if they will be responsible for maintaining it!
